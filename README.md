# EmissionLoggerUsingSpringBoot
This Project is to demonstrate "Carbon emission Logger" . The carbon emission logger represents a web server that is accepting emission records. These events log carbon emissions for different kind of products.   They use co2tonnes as unit, include a recoding date and reference each product by an id: POST /emissions {  id: String,  productId: String,  emission: Float,  recordedAt: Date }   In addition it is possible to query statistics for each product: GET /stats/&lt;productId>   This route returns an object with the following data: The day with highest recorded emissions An average of emissions per day and the total amount of emissions since recording.
